**Clean up HTML rich text and please your editor.** I've used it for copying from a word processor to Anki and making sure Anki receives semantic HTML rather than messy editor-specific HTML, but that's just one usecase. It's useful whenever you want to put copied-and-pasted content into a rich text input, or when converting HTML to copiable rich text and vice versa.

Use it simply by cloning the repo and opening the `index.html` in a web browser!
