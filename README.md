# neattribute
**✨ Clean up HTML rich text and please your editor!**

I've used it for copying from a word processor to Anki and making sure Anki receives semantic HTML rather than messy editor-specific HTML, but that's just one usecase. It's useful whenever you want to put copied-and-pasted content into a rich text input, or when converting HTML to copiable rich text and vice versa.

[▶️ Use it here](https://webcoder49.dev/neattribute), or by cloning the repo and opening the `index.html` in a web browser. Everything you do stays locally on your machine!

## Project Philosophy
- *It's minimal, uses native browser features wherever possible, and gets the job done.*
- It also heavily depends on [my `code-input` library](https://github.com/WebCoder49/code-input), and its use helps uncover upstream bugs!
